# 2. PRD-Plus: AI Job Application Assistant

This document refines the PRD by adding details about edge cases, user-facing copy, and error handling.

## 1. Edge Cases & Special Scenarios

-   **EC-001: No New Jobs Found:** If the scraper runs and finds no new jobs since the last run, the system should log this event silently and finish. It should not send a "No jobs found" notification to avoid unnecessary noise.
-   **EC-002: Invalid Session Cookies:** If the scraper fails to authenticate using the `cookies.json` file (e.g., the session has expired), it must immediately stop and send a specific error notification to the user via Telegram: *"CRITICAL: LinkedIn authentication failed. Please refresh your session cookies."*
-   **EC-003: No "Good Fit" Jobs:** If the scraper finds new jobs, but the Job Validation Agent filters all of them out, the system should log this and finish. No notification should be sent.
-   **EC-004: Generation Agent Fails:** If the Content Generation Agent fails to produce a resume/CV draft after 3 retries for a qualified job, it should log the error, skip that job, and continue to the next one. It should not halt the entire process.
-   **EC-005: LinkedIn UI Changes:** If a change in LinkedIn's website HTML causes the scraper to fail, the script should terminate gracefully and log the specific scraping error. An alert should be sent to the user: *"ALERT: The LinkedIn scraper failed, possibly due to a site update. The tool may require maintenance."*

## 2. User-Facing Copy

This section defines the exact text to be used in notifications.

### UFC-001: Successful Job Notification

-   **Purpose:** To inform the user of a new, qualified job opportunity with all generated materials.
-   **Format:** Telegram Message
-   **Content:**
    ```
    New Qualified Job Found!

    **Job Title:** {job_title}
    **Company:** {company_name}
    **Location:** {job_location}

    **Link:** {job_url}

    ---

    Suggested Resume Changes:
    - {suggestion_1}
    - {suggestion_2}
    - {suggestion_3}

    ---

    Generated Cover Letter:
    {cover_letter_text}
    ```

### UFC-002: Authentication Failure Notification

-   **Purpose:** To alert the user that their session cookies are invalid and need to be refreshed.
-   **Format:** Telegram Message
-   **Content:**
    ```
    CRITICAL: LinkedIn authentication failed.

    The scraper could not log in to LinkedIn using the current session cookies. They have likely expired.

    **Action Required:** Please run the manual authentication script on your local machine to generate a new `cookies.json` file and update it on the server.
    ```

### UFC-003: Scraper Failure Notification

-   **Purpose:** To alert the user that the scraper itself has broken, likely due to a change in LinkedIn's website.
-   **Format:** Telegram Message
-   **Content:**
    ```
    ALERT: The LinkedIn scraper failed.

    The scraper was unable to process the job search results page. This may be due to a recent update to LinkedIn's website structure.

    **Action Required:** The scraper code may require maintenance. Please check the system logs for details.
    ```

## 3. Data & Configuration Schema

-   **`search_urls.txt`:** A plain text file where each line is a full URL to a LinkedIn job search results page.
-   **`cookies.json`:** The JSON object exported from a browser session containing authentication cookies.
-   **`resume.json`:** A JSON file structuring the user's resume. **Note:** This file serves as a structured *input* for the Content Generation Agent. The system will *not* generate a fully formatted resume document as output; its sole responsibility is to provide text-based suggestions for bullet point changes.
