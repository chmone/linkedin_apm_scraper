# 1. Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Job Application Assistant

## 1. Overview & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered agent that automates the process of finding and preparing applications for Product Management roles. The vision is to create a personal, proactive assistant that gives the user a significant speed and quality advantage in their job search.

## 2. Target User & Use Case

-   **User:** A job seeker looking for early-career Product Management roles (1-3 years experience) in New York or San Francisco.
-   **Use Case:** The user wants to be instantly notified of new, relevant job postings and receive high-quality, tailored application materials (resume bullets, cover letter) for each one, allowing them to apply within minutes of a role being posted.

## 3. Key Features & Functional Requirements

### FR-001: Job Scraping (Manual Trigger)

-   **Description:** The system must be able to scrape job postings from LinkedIn.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   A script/function can be manually executed to initiate a scraping run.
    -   The scraper will iterate through a list of LinkedIn search result URLs provided in a `.txt` file.
    -   The scraper must operate within an authenticated LinkedIn session to access search results.

### FR-001a: Scraper Authentication

-   **Description:** The scraper must be able to authenticate as the user to perform searches.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The system will not handle username/password logins directly.
    -   Authentication will be achieved by loading session cookies from a `cookies.json` file into the Selenium browser instance.
    -   A separate, documented process will exist for the user to manually generate and refresh this `cookies.json` file as needed.

### FR-002: Agent-based Filtering & Validation

-   **Description:** An AI agent will analyze each scraped job to determine if it's a "good fit" based on a user-defined profile.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The system will have a configuration file or document where the user can define their "ideal job profile." This profile will be a natural language description covering factors like desired company culture, product space, team size, and specific responsibilities.
    -   An AI agent (using Google ADK) will read the full text of each job description and compare it semantically to the user's ideal job profile.
    -   The agent will output a list of "qualified" jobs that meet the criteria from those scraped.

### FR-003: Tailored Content Generation

-   **Description:** For each qualified job, a second AI agent will generate a tailored resume and cover letter.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The system will be provided with a `resume.json` file containing the user's experience and a separate set of documents representing the user's writing style.
    -   The "Content Generation Agent" will analyze the qualified job's description.
    -   It will suggest changes to the user's existing resume bullet points in the format: `[Old Bullet] -> [New Bullet] (Explanation for change)`. The agent will decide which bullet points are best to replace or modify.
    -   It will generate a draft cover letter in the user's writing style, ensuring the output does not exceed one page.

### FR-004: Content Review & Verification Loop

-   **Description:** A third AI agent will review the generated content for quality and relevance before sending it to the user.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The "Content-Review Agent" will check the *suggested bullet point changes* and the cover letter against the job description for keyword alignment, relevance, and tone.
    -   The agent will assign a quality score. If the score is below a predefined threshold, it will provide feedback to the Content Generation Agent, which will then create a new version.
    -   This loop will run up to 3 times to ensure quality.
    -   The final, approved content will be passed to the notification step.

### FR-005: Telegram Notification

-   **Description:** The system will send a message to the user via Telegram with the finalized job application materials.
-   **Acceptance Criteria:**
    -   The system will integrate with the Telegram Bot API.
    -   A successful notification will be sent to a user-specified Telegram chat ID.
    -   The message will contain:
        -   Job Title & Company
        -   A link to the job posting
        -   The generated resume bullet points
        -   The generated cover letter

## 4. Technical Framework

-   **Agent Orchestration:** [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) will be used to manage the sequential workflow and the agents.
-   **Backend Language:** Python

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **NFR-001 (Modularity):** Each agent (Scraper, Job Validator, Content Generator, Content Reviewer, Notifier) should be a distinct, modular component.
-   **NFR-002 (Configurability):** Search terms, locations, API keys (Telegram), and the "ideal job profile" must be stored in a configuration file for easy modification.
-   **NFR-003 (Manual Submission):** The system will **not** automatically submit applications. The final step is always a notification, requiring user review and manual submission.

## 6. Success Metrics (Initial)

-   The system successfully identifies and notifies the user of at least one qualified job within its first week of use.
-   The generated content is high-quality enough that the user can use it with only minor edits for over 50% of the qualified jobs.
-   The end-to-end process from scraping to notification completes successfully without errors.
