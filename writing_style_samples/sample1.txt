As a product leader, I believe in building products that are not only functional but also delightful to use. My approach is rooted in a deep understanding of user needs, which I translate into a clear and compelling product vision. I drive execution through a collaborative, data-informed process, ensuring that we are always focused on delivering the most impactful features for our customers. I am a strong communicator and am passionate about building consensus and excitement around the product, both internally and externally.
