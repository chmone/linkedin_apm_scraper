My professional philosophy is built on the idea of constructive resilience. I believe that true innovation doesn't come from avoiding failure, but from interrogating it. In my previous roles, I've made it a practice to dissect not only our successes but also our missteps with a kind of forensic curiosity. What were the assumptions that led us astray? Where did our data fail to tell the whole story? This process isn't about assigning blame; it's about building a more robust institutional memory. By transforming setbacks into a library of shared wisdom, I've helped my teams build not just better products, but a better, more adaptive development process. True strength isn't about being unbreakable; it's about reassembling stronger in the broken places.
