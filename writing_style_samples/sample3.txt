I view product development as an exercise in relinquishing control. It's easy to fall into the trap of believing we, as creators, know what is best for the user. We build our own elegant roadmaps and beautiful, logical feature sets. But the real world is never so clean. My approach is to intentionally break that illusion of control by building tight feedback loops and prioritizing raw, unfiltered user feedback from day one. It's about creating a system, not just a productâ€”a system that can listen, adapt, and evolve in ways we couldn't have predicted. The goal isn't to perfectly execute a pre-written plan, but to build a product that is resilient enough to be shaped by its users. The most successful products are the ones that learn to serve the people who use them, not just the vision of the people who made them.
